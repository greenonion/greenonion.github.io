These are some of the most interesting books I've read or want to read. In the manner of 
[Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf), this aims to simulate
the piles of books I have around me and on my shelves. There is no single unifying theme,
although the past few years I've been reading a lot about product, business, strategy,
and history. I also love fiction.
