These are some of the most interesting books I've read or want to read. In the manner of 
[Patrick Collison's bookshelf](https://patrickcollison.com/bookshelf), this is not organized
and aims to simulate the piles of books I have around me and on my shelves. I will probably
create some separate lists of my favorite books around specific topics at some point.
